# CS Ticketing System - Modulith

Code base for this [medium article](https://medium.com/@albert.llousas/building-a-microservices-ready-modulith-91f08f552cf3).

This code sets up a simple ticketing system with a few modules. The goal is to show how to build a modular monolith that can be easily transformed into microservices.

It sets a very basic set of functionalities, enough to explore the pattern but not a lot of stuff missing for a prod ready solution.
