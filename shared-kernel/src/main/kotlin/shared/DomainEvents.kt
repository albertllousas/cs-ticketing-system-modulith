//Different Domain Responsibilities
//Agent Management:
//Focuses on managing agents as users or resources:
//Lifecycle: Create, update, activate, deactivate.
//Roles and permissions: Tier 1, Tier 2, Supervisor.
//Availability: Online/offline status.
//Workload tracking.
//Assignment:
//Focuses on managing ticket-to-agent relationships:
//Assignment rules (e.g., assigning tickets based on workload, skills, or SLA priorities).
//Reassignments and escalations.
//Tracking which agent is responsible for which tickets.

//
//1. Potential Bounded Context: Agent Workspace
//A dedicated bounded context called the Agent Workspace Context could be created to handle the agent's user experience, including their "home" and tools for managing tasks and tickets.
//
//2. Responsibilities of the Agent Workspace Context
//a. Aggregating Data Across Contexts
//The Agent Workspace Context would aggregate data from multiple other bounded contexts (e.g., Ticket Management, Prioritization, Assignment) to provide the agent with a unified view of their tasks, tickets, and workflows.
//
//It doesnâ€™t "own" ticket data or prioritization logic but consumes them through queries or event streams.
//It focuses on presenting information to the agent and orchestrating workflows relevant to them.
//b. Agent-Specific Workflows
//This context could manage workflows that are specific to agents, such as:
//
//Listing assigned tickets or tasks.
//Displaying priorities, deadlines, or SLAs.
//Highlighting notifications (e.g., escalations, unresolved tickets).
//Managing workload (e.g., tracking active vs. completed tasks).
//c. Personalization and Dashboard
//Agents may have personalized dashboards or tools based on:
//
//Their role (e.g., Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 support).
//Their current workload.
//Recommendations or guidance (e.g., suggested tickets to handle next based on priority).
